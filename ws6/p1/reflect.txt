errors which I was facing when I was trying to define the functions.

In this workshop, I implemented the Numbers class which is responsible for reading numbers from a file, 
storing them in an array, and providing various functions to work with the data. During the implementation,
 I faced several challenges that I overcame by seeking help from online resources such as YouTube videos.

One of the main difficulties in this program was managing memory correctly. The class contains several dynamic 
arrays, which must be allocated and deallocated properly to avoid memory leaks. To address this issue, the class 
defines a constructor, a destructor, and several helper functions, such as "setEmpty", "load", and "isEmpty",
 which are used to manage the memory.

Another difficulty in this program was dealing with input/output operations. The class uses file I/O to read and write 
the collection of numbers. To address this issue, the class defines several functions, such as "load" and "countLines", 
which are used to read the numbers from a file, and "save", which is used to write the numbers to a file.
